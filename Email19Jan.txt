Please note that Realtair is a must have for each lead agent in an office.
All reccommendations below assume that offices have realtair for all their senior agents.

VaultRE - Is Suitable as a "Source of Truth CRM"
-> Paying for each office
-> Nothing to be changed
 - Used by other companies as well
 - other companies have modified it for their usage i.e. compass plus

FMS VaultRE - Suitable as a very surface level admin panel and communication platform
-> Paying for FMS
-> Nothing to be changed
 - Required for us to look at and monitor activity for all offices
 - Useful as a communication tool with franchises

Projects Module - Not assessed
-> Paying for one module for one office
-> No reccommendation as I have not used this
 - Do not have the ability to look through this
 - Will contact Adrijana

Agora Insights - Having a trial period for Oran Park (not promising)
-> Paying for 7 accounts right now (one for each office)
-> Should only be paying for 6 accounts as MD Project doesn't need Agora Insights
 - Next Tuesday (27th Jan), we will know if Agora Insights is good enough for us

Secure Sign - Poor UI and bad value
-> Paying for 35 accounts right now
-> Cancel all licenses
 - Costs $15 /user/month (cheaper than all industry alternatives)
 - the poor user experience makes it bad value even though its so cheap
 - Will be replaced by Realtair and thus has a poor value proposition
 - One personal docusign account per office is cheaper and better
 - realtair will replace some of the functionality, docusign will replace the other functionality

Agent Proposals - suitable for creating listing proposals and presentations, will be replaced by Realtair
-> Paying for 2 accounts right now (was meant to only be for Oran Park)
-> Cancel both (replace with Realtair)
 - Was suitable for creating proposals and listing presentations
 - Realtair will replace this tool
